Rules of WAR:

1) Players are each dealt half the deck in an alternating pattern.
2) Players each take their top card and lay it face UP.
3) If the cards' rank is the same i.e. 3 of clubs and 3 of hearts, players take ANOTHER card and lay it face DOWN, then repeat step 2.
4) If the last drawn cards are different ranks, all the cards drawn in this round are awarded to the drawer of the higher ranked card.
4) If either player runs out of cards at any time, that player loses and the game ends.
